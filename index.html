        Maria Callas is arguably the most influential soprano of the twentieth century in the operatic world.
        She launched her career in Greece and performed at the most prestigious opera houses around the globe
        ending her career in London, England. Her coloratura and bel canto styles are still held to be of the
        highest standards by many opera singers today.
